# Project Highlights
This project uses the following tech stack, please use best practices when implementing any requested features:
- Vite
- React
- Typescript
- shadcn UI - https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components
- FastAPI (python)
- SQLAlchemy using SQLite3
- Alembic for database migrations

# Things you must do
- Validate your changes with linters and tests where available
- Ensure that all UI elements text match the light and dark themes
- If you must run the webserver or the API server, just run `make` while in `web` or `api` directories
- Keep code clean with proper whitespace formatting (no trailing spaces)
- Validate API changes using linters and tests rather than running servers
- Write minimal, focused code that is self-explanatory; add comments only for complex logic

# Things you may do
- You may install new Shadcn components
- You may install new python libraries if needed
- You may install new npm packages if needed
- Add comments when implementing significantly complex modifications
