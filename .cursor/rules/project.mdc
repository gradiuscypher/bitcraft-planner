# Project Highlights
This project uses the following tech stack, please use best practices when implementing any requested features:
- Vite
- React
- Typescript
- shadcn UI - https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components
- FastAPI (python)
- SQLAlchemy using SQLite3
- Alembic for database migrations

# Things you must do
- Validate your changes with linters and tests where available
- Ensure that all UI elements text match the light and dark themes
- If you must run the webserver or the API server, just run `make` while in `web` or `api` directories

# Things you may do
- You may install new Shadcn components
- You may install new python libraries if needed
- You may install new npm packages if needed

# Things you must not do
- You do not need to write documentation for the features you create
- Do not try to run the project API or webserver. Validate your API changes via linters and testing.
- Do not include unneeded blank spaces in lines. If a line is intended to be a new line, there should be no additional space or tab characters in that line.
- Do not add comments unless the modifications you're making are significantly complex. If you're in doubt, default to not adding comments.
